This describes analysis scripts for basic sequence processing steps, canonical correspondence analysis and relative activity recovery calculations in the DWDSOME project. The steps used in the analysis for results in Inkinen et al. (submitted to Microbiome journal 2019) are detailed in the script.sh file. Basic steps and detail parameters are used to allow to reproduce the basic sequence processing. Contact the authors for any clarification needed in the code: jenni.inkinen@thl.fi (canonical correspondence analysis and relative activity recovery calculations) or  balamuralikrishna.jayaprakash@thl.fi (basic sequence processing) or ivan.ryzhikov@uef.fi (CCA plots)
